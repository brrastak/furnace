# Furnace for glass fusing

Glass fusing - joining of the pieces of glass. Glass isn't really melted, but is softer than in the normal condition. Planned furnace maximum temperature - 900 Â°C. Unfortunetely, the project was cancelled due to political reasons. I just want to close my gestalt and finish at least PCBs and firmware.

TODO: more detailed description.
